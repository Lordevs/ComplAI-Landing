              Compl-AI was founded by lawyers who know firsthand the frustration
              of overpriced, profit-driven legal software. We understand what it
              feels like to be taken advantage of by big software companies that
              charge high fees while offering little flexibility. That’s why
              we’re building something different.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our commitment is to make powerful, reliable compliance support
              accessible to everyone — not just large firms with big budgets.
              Supporting us means being part of a movement that prioritises
              fairness, practicality, and affordability. We believe that small
              firms and solo practitioners should not be priced out of the tools
              they need to stay compliant.
            </p>
            <p>
              By backing Compl-AI, you’re helping to put an end to the outdated
              model of exploiting the legal sector. Together, we’re proving that
              compliance can be effective, accessible, and fair.
